Using Gemini to decide tech stack : Python, Requests + BeautifulSoup,  
Tech choice:
	Language: Python - since i had learnt this before but didn't using it that much
	Library: Requests + BeautifulSoup - it's easy to set up and fit well with small independent project
	Framework: Flask - need a website so everybody can login paste their profile link, it's for a small community about 100-200 ppl so 
			Feature		Django											Flask										FastAPI
			Approach	Batteries-included framework					Microframework, more customization			Opinionated framework, focused on APIs
			Complexity	More complex setup and structure				Simpler setup, more manual configuration	Simpler setup, automatic features
			Use cases	Complex web applications, user authentication	Smaller projects, flexible API development	RESTful APIs, microservices
			Performance	Generally good, can be optimized				Highly performant							Excellent performance, asynchronous support
